There is an ever-growing volume of patents being produced.  The classification of these patents into correct categories is of importance to help increase the efficiency of the system as a whole. Therefore, we explored two supervised classification methods to assist with the classification into the current system, support vector machines and maximum entropy.  We also explore dimensionality reduction techniques to attempt to increase the efficiency of this system.  Finally, we discuss the difficulty of the task and examine the natural lexical clustering of patent topics to show how the man made categories hinder machine learning attempts <- ((something like that but better)) attempt to determine if the current category classifications are actually natural given a sample of patents, or if there may exist more natural classification categories than are already in use.
