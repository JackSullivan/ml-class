\section{Methods}
%%Just have dataset here instead of a whole separate section? If it's in it's own section then we can give a fuller background on the classes and maybe an explanation of the coherence scores
\subsection{Data Set}

\subsection{Supervised Methods}
For the first experiment, the dataset was created such that each of the 7 classification categories were evenly represented with 200? samples each.  (Define Training/Testing and re-run experiment)
%% Tempted to make this it's own section as well
\subsection{Dimensionality Reduction}
For the second experiment, the dataset from experiment one had two different dimensionality reduction techniques used to reduce the dataset.  The two included PCA and a Laplacian Eigenmap.  (Define Training/Testing and re-run experiment)
\subsection{Boosting Methods}
For the third experiment, we attempted to determine if more data would noticeably improve the results of the algorithm.  Specifically, the dataset was expanded to approximately 2000 samples each. (Define Training/Testing and re-run experiment)
