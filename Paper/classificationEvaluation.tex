\section{Classification Evaluation}
In addition to determining how to best classify patents using the CPC labeling scheme, we wanted to evaluate the class system defined by the Patent office.  The patent class system takes it's class structure from the International Patent Classification scheme originated as a result of 1956's European Convention on the International Classification of Patents for Invention in 1968.  Since it's origin, it has been updated in eight editions, the last in 2006.  Despite multiple editions, the top eight categories we examine in this work have not been altered.
  
While the top structure has remained the same, the different types of new technologies are ever changing.  
As many Machine Learning problems have shown previously, tasks which are easy for human's are not easy for machines.  The distinction between a patent in the field of physics and a patent in the field of electricity becomes a difficult problem when the classifier has to rely on only n-grams of terms. 

We observed in our samples that the distribution of incoming patents is shewed.  The proportions of each group in our dataset of patents can be seen in Table Z.  It can be assumed that this distribution can be generalized to the full set of patents.  To investigate how this affects supervised classification, we employed unsupervised methods to generate topics from the dataset of patents.
